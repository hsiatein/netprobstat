如下是要求，以higgs-mention_network.edgelist为数据，使用python+网络分析模块（尽可能快）来实现，完成Stage 2的网络分析，并且将需要的那些分析结果算出来后，写进report.tex里

Math6116P Course Project-Network Data Analysis

1. Project Overview
•	Explore real-world network datasets using probabilistic and statistical analysis.
•	Each student selects one open-source network dataset.
•	Tasks: data visualization, descriptive statistics, modeling, and reporting.
•	Deliverables: midterm presentation, final report, and final presentation.
Goals: - Understand key properties of network data. - Apply graph-theoretic and statistical methods to analyze network structures. - Gain hands-on experience using tools such as NetworkX, igraph, or Gephi.

Stage 1: ......
Stage 2: Network Analysis (Final Project)
Perform advanced analyses, such as: 1. Centrality analysis: degree, betweenness, closeness, eigenvector. 2. Community detection: modularity, Louvain or Leiden algorithms. 3. Weighted / directed graph analysis. 4. Comparative study: multiple networks or subnetworks. 5. Probabilistic modeling: stochastic model, ERGM. 6. Dynamic analysis: network evolution over time.
Deliverables: - Written Report (6–8 pages) - Final Presentation (10–12 slides) summarizing main results and interpretations.
